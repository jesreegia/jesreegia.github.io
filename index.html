									<h2>VA Experience</h2>
						
								</header>
							
								<p class="content">I’ve been working as a Virtual Assistant since December 2021, specializing in supporting insurance agencies with both Personal and Commercial lines across multiple U.S. states—including Florida, New Jersey, New York, Louisiana, Colorado, Oregon, North Carolina, and Missouri. This diverse exposure has equipped me with a solid understanding of state-specific insurance requirements and operational workflows.

I am detail-oriented, dependable, and dedicated to helping agencies stay organized, compliant, and client-focused. With hands-on experience across all five stages of the insurance process, I’ve consistently provided smooth, end-to-end support for every agency I’ve worked with.

I enjoy streamlining processes, adapting to new systems, and optimizing daily operations to improve productivity. Additionally, I am proficient in working with multiple carrier platforms, including Progressive, Travelers, Safeco, Farmers, Foremost, Auto-Owners, Citizens, Nationwide, Hartford, NatGen, Orion, Markel, Wright Flood, American Strategic, American Modern, Johnson & Johnson, Lititz, Orion180, Acuity, and many more.</p>
												<p>Let me take care of the back-office work—so you can say goodbye to paperwork overload <br>and focus your energy on what matters most: growing your business and serving your clients.</p>

She was an absolute joy to work with. Jesree was able to pick up any of the customer service work I gave her and accurately complete each task. She is a quick learner, I would show her how to do something once, and then she was able to complete the work. 
I would highly recommend Jesree!
